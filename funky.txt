[Verse 1: Antwaun Stanley (Theo Katzman, Keith Kinnear, Mike Shea)]
He's on the spleen (Uh he's the funky duck)
He's the first to leave (Uh he's the funky duck)
Drinking Ovaltine (Uh he's the funky duck)
Since he was 14 (He's the funky duck)
He's self-aware (Uh he's the funky duck)
He gave the first TED talk (Uh he's the funky duck)
Can't remember names (Uh he's the funky duck)
Treats you all the same (He's the funky duck)

[Chorus: Antwaun Stanley Antwaun Stanley, Theo Katzman, Keith Kinnear, Mike Shea]
Wahoo
He's a funky duck
Wahoo
He's a funky duck
Ohhhhh
He's a funky duck
Wahoo
He's a funky duck

[Verse 2: Antwaun Stanley (Theo Katzman, Keith Kinnear, Mike Shea)]
He's not a duck (He's the funky duck)
I said he's not a duck (Uh he's the funky duck)
He ain't no duck (Uh he's the funky duck)
He's a funky duck (He's the funky duck)
He's a funky duck (He's the funky duck)
I said that he's a funky duck (funky duck)
I-I-I-I-I funky duck (Uh he's the funky duck)
Funky funky funky funky duck (He's the funky duck)

[Chorus]
Oh wahoo
He's a funky duck
I said wahoo
Ooh, ooh (funky duck)
Ooh, ooh (funky duck)
Ooh, ooh, ooh! (funky duck)

[Verse 3]
Funky duck (He's a funky duck)
He's a fu-fun-fun-funky duck (He's a funky duck)
He's a funky duck (funky duck) ah funk, funk
He's a funky duck (Uh he's a funky duck)
I thought I saw a funky duck 'round here somewhere
He owns a truck (funky duck)
But, but he drives a Saab (funky duck)
Oh!
